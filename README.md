Proposal: Bill Split Application 
              Reasoning: Eating/Hanging out with friends and paying the full bill, it'd take too much work to calculate every           other member's tabs on a calculator. Therefore by creating a splitter app, it'd solve the problem and thus only requiring one person to input values 
  Must Have Features: Assigning Values to their respected items and user 
                      Multiple Variation of Tip Choices (10, 15, 20, etc)
                      Input for users to insert names and price
                      Displaying end result of how much each user has to pay according to their inputted values
                      Multiple pages for aesthetic purposes
            
  Nice to Have Features: Sign up and Login Feature
                         Creating Groups and adding others through either email/phone number (from login)
                         Displaying/Checking who has paid and who hasn't paid
                         Currency Conversions
                         Taking image of receipt and displaying on screen
                         Payment through linking Venmo, Paypal, and/or other transaction method
